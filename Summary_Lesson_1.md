**Connor - Programming Review Lesson 1 and notes**  

This is a simple review of the first 6 hours coding we've done together so far. If you want we can use this site deliberately to build up a record of the ideas and syntax you've had to learn so far. 

This actual page will be updated with bits of code and maybe some pictures as necessary. We can also build you a site of your own to play with if you want to do html/css.

Finally, we can also work out a means of summarising our maths lessons and your own maths knowledge here if you want.

**This is the stuff we covered last week and previously:**  


1.   Unity - Window layout and the console
1.   Running a game
1.   Unity - adding a script to a game object (new empty)
1.   Editing a script in Visual Studio and saving it.
 
**Programming ideas:**

1.    Startonce and update
1.    Writing things to the screen
1.    Checking what key was pressed and responding
1.    Making choices: Guessing game with the IF statement
1.    Variables
1.    Loops - lets repeat ourselves until something changes.
1.    Void - the selfish function 
1.    Int and other unselfish functions - they always give you something back - because they have to, otherwise they'd be void.
1.    Don't repeat yourself, putting repeated things in a function. Remember the box idea?
1.    Arrays - they're just a bunch of variables with a house number attached to each right?
1.    2D arrays - remember how annoying it was to find out what the numbers were going to be? 
1.    Drawing squares

This is a bonus bit: I think you should consider knowing this u:.
