<h2>Mental Models and learning</h2>
</div>
 
<div class="Box">
<P><B>How you model a concept in your head
determines depth of understanding of the concept &ndash; and what use
you can make of it</B>.</p> 

 
</div>
 
<div class="Box">
<P>When I need to travel to a new location
how well I recall the route depends on one of the following:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>I was taken there.</P>
	<LI><P>I used a GPS</P>
	<LI><P>I made a mental model of the route
	&ndash; this means taking a journey in my mind, seeing the turns and
	land marks as clearly as I can. This technique is even easier now
	with Google streetview.</P>
</OL>
<P>
</P>
<P>If I use either 1 or 2, I may never
fully know how to get to a new place without the assist. However, if
I use 3, I nearly always drive straight to it.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Point 3 is an example of a mental
model; it's creation requires specific attention and technique &ndash;
it's simple, even obvious yet unless I use it, it would seem I didn't
have any sense of direction in a new location.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The same notion of creating deliberate
models of ideas applies to anything we can learn. Some material lends
itself directly to making easy mental models &ndash; basic mechanics,
carpentry, building are good examples. They require concrete
interaction, it's quite easy to imagine seeing and feeling how things
go together and what the end result might be. <I>This does get more
challenging at the more expert end of the scale as there are more
concepts to work with. For example, trying to imagine how a change in
alloys used in a cylinder head affects it's material properties when
running is a task for computer modelling tools. However, even here an
experienced engineer may well have a reasonable estimate between
widely contrasting alloys: too hard = fracture risk; too flexible =
wear risk.</I></P>
 
</div>
<div class="Box">
<P><b>This idea of making
mental models is one that can make a tremendous difference between
understanding and using knowledge vs merely memorising pieces of it.</b></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>For example:</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>I have a machine
that takes in a list of numbers, grouped in batches of 3. You feed
the instructions into a slot that pulls the list in, one batch of 3
at a time &ndash; each batch is an instruction, each instruction
requests one of twenty shapes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the top of a
machine is a large tank that has thousands of tiny geometric shapes
inside. There are only 20 different types of shape. Each one is a
type of magnetic - think of magnetic toys like this
<a href="http://iqmagtoy.com/building/amazing.htm">Magnetic Toys </a></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the back of the
machine there is an output pipe, with a chain made from the shapes in
the tank. As the length of the chain increases, it flexes and warps
due to the combined influence of the different shapes that make it
up. This time, it comes out coiled.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A machine like this
is easy to imagine. You can also imagine how the list is made &ndash;
perhaps stamped out, instruction by instruction from a template.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once you have
imagined such a machine, it's fairly easy to remember and perhaps
even apply the idea to another type of machine.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In this instance,
in a simplistic* fashion, I described the notion of RNA &rarr;
Polypeptide synthesis via ribosome. In other words, how you get from
DNA to a protein. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In terms of
learning new concepts, the idea of deliberately choosing how to make
a model in your mind of what you are learning can be very powerful.
When I first learnt to program, copy and paste coding was common.
Fortunately, this stage lasted for a short time as such a method
means you can't understand the why behind the code.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Still, for a long
time, a lot of coding I worked on I found syntax to be a constant
bane. The simplistic answer would be to memorise syntax &ndash; a
question seen on StackOverFlow and Quora quite often.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet, such a task &ndash;
even if successful &ndash; lends itself to a low return on investment
(ROI). We arrive at the point of mental models : return on
investment.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each fact, that is
rote memorised, in relative isolation yields a linear ROI. Your skill
and knowledge of an area can be charted on a small graph directly in
proportion to the number of facts you learnt. This is the land of
trivial pursuit mastery. That is not to say facts are not important,
quite the reverse, but the rote memorising of them is the least
efficient method of knowledge acquisition I know of.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Like many things,
knowledge itself has structure &ndash; for the purposes of this
article, I'm simplifying this idea enormously. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>So, what is more
useful to learn than facts?</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rules and the
principles behind them. Rules in many systems of knowledge generate
facts of various kinds &ndash; whether we are using engineering
calculations to work out what our ideal alloy should be for that
cylinder head or whether we can predict from an RNA sequence that we
will get a beta sheet or alpha helix secondary structure for our new
protein chain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principles are
the foundations from which the rules will spring &ndash; there are
often many of these at play to produce the rules we can rely on.
Going back to RNA &rarr; protein as an example, what are the
principles then? Here are some, loosely summarised:</P>
<P>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Magnetism and
	polar vs non polar molecules.</P>
	<LI><P>For the shape
	of a molecule, we can look at valence shell electron repulsion
	theory to derive bond angles, from there we have aS model of how a
	collection of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and other atoms will bond
	together.</P>
	<LI><P>Lowest energy
	principle will guide what the model of this collection will actually
	look like.</P>
</OL>
<P>
</P>
<P>From these we can
predict which direction the next amino acid will bend towards based
on it's charge profile vs it's predecessor. To do this we can also
build a model of how each shape will actually look and finally, to
determine the secondary structure &ndash; sheet or coil &ndash; we
can use calculations based on the ideas of the lowest energy
principle**. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The example above
is rather rough example of deriving knowledge, rules from a
principle. However, principles or underlying theory, often lend
themselves to being mentally modelled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For me a test of
understanding is simply whether I've been able to construct a model
that I can use about the theory or principle in question.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To understand RNA
transcription, an small mental animation, similar to my description,
gave me a foundation to hang finer details on. The nice part about
any mental model that can be seen and touched, is you can hang finer
detail onto it, refine it over years and work with it.</P>
<P>The subject of
metaphor and analogy becomes central to the creation of mental
models.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To create a mental
model is a deliberate conscious act: You see, maybe feel how the
thing goes together and you may well have to talk your way through it
as you build the model. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Diagrams, physical
models, searches online for suitable analogies are often required.
Metaphors and analogies are bridges between concepts, known and
unknown. Creating or finding ones that are useful for understanding
new ideas is a critical practice as this is the core of understanding
how exactly you think about a new idea.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Understanding how
you think or represent new pieces of knowledge to yourself lies at
the root of meta cognition or learning how to learn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Here, I've
attempted to illustrate the general idea of how and why you would
examine your own internal representation of any new concept. And the
benefits of deliberately creating a metaphorical mental model that
you can see and touch.</P>
<P>
</P>
</div>
<P>
</P>
<div class="Box">
<P><I>*In this example, there is an
important aspect to mental models that needs addressing: when you
create one, it is a product of your thoughts and as such can also
become a limiting bias if it is not sufficiently tested and validated
against reality. A model is a simplification and by it's nature omits
information. Here, I skip the precursor of DNA-&gt;RNA transcription
mechanisms, the finer details of exactly how the amino acid shapes
are joined to the resulting polypeptide and much more.</I></P>

<div class="Box">

<P>** <I>To get a
mental model of this idea &ndash; think of a bubble, whether it's on
a surface like water or in the air, it always tends towards a
spherical shape. It's the simplest for the conditions at hand.
Another way to see it, a ball always rolls down the steepest
gradient.</I></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><I>We could easily
elaborate on the notion of the steepest gradient by asking the
question &ndash; if the ball is balanced on a hill &ndash; a tiny
hill &ndash; and it can choose any direction possible, which way does
it go. In an abstract mental model, you can imagine no other forces
other than gravity and an ideal surface. So no gravel, fine bumps on
the ball surface or any other interference. It's that model I use for
my example!</I></P>
